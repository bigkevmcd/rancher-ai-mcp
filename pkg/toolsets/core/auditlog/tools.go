		Description: `Searches the Rancher API audit log to find who did what and when, for example who created, changed or deleted a user, role binding, cluster or other resource.
Entries are returned newest first with the user ID, username, auth provider and principal ID of the user that made the request, the real user that impersonated it (impersonatedBy) if any, the login name of login requests, HTTP method, request URI, response code, timestamps and a truncated request body.
All filters are optional and are combined with AND. To find changes rather than reads, set method to "POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE".
Resources are often referred to by ID in request URIs and bodies (e.g. u-abc12 for users), so look up the resource ID first (e.g. with getUser) and search for both the ID and the name.
The audit log is read from the rancher-audit-log sidecar container of the Rancher pods, so Rancher must be installed with auditLog.enabled=true and auditLog.destination=sidecar. Only entries still in the current container log are available.

Results are paginated with limit (page size, default 50) and offset (how many matching entries to skip, default 0). When more entries remain, the response includes the exact offset value to pass in for the next page, and an until value that keeps the pages stable while new requests are logged. Each call reads the log again.`},
